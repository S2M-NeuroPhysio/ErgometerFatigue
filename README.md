## Fatigue project
MATLAB-based user interfaces for applying the ergometer to the experimental paradigms. The interface will be used to provide 1) visual feedback, 2) data acquisition via National Instrument 9205, and 3) sending and receiving the triggers for the purpose of synchronizing signal recording (EEG, EMG, voltage...etc.).

## Equiptments 
(1) Ergometer
(2) Computer with a serial port
(3) NI 9205 (the default analog input is 23, "AO23")
(4) Monitor (HDMI)
Optional: We use the Vicon system to record the torques and the trigger impulse. 

## Visual interface
Purpose of the experiment...
The ratio(percentage) of applied force to  MVC will be presented in the format of a real-time bar. The height of the bar represents the percentage. The experimental task is finished until the participant feels fatigued.
