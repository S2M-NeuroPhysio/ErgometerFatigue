# Installation and environment
1) Download the files in the folder, and set the path to your current folder. 
2) Check the address of the serial port sending the trigger from your computer (Device manager -> COM & Serial port -> Resources). You can test the address in "test_TTL.m", preferably via MATLAB 2020.
3)  If step 2 works, edit the address in the Matlab files (Ergometer_Baseline.m & Ergometer_GUI_APP.m).
4) Make sure Psychtoolbox (PTB) is downloaded in your MATLAB (if none, check here: http://psychtoolbox.org/download.html).
5) Run "Ergometer_Baseline.m" to record baseline and MVC.
6) Run "Ergometer_GUI_APP.m" to start the experiment.

# What's the purpose of each file?
1) Ergometer_Baseline.m :
2) Ergometer_GUI_APP.m :
3) ClosePTB.m :
4) io64.mexw64 :
5) test_TTL.m :
